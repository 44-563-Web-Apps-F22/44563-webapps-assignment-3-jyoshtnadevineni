    <h2> My favourite museum to visit is Victoria museum</h2>
    <p>Victoria Jubilee Museum, this museum of the Archaeological Department was built in 1887
     to honour the Golden jubilee coronation of Queen Victoria.
    the museum  contains an <b>idol of Lord Shiva</b>, dating back to 4th - 5th century. 
     This idol is <b> prime attraction of the museum</b>.
